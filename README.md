Challenge
There are some wild 'older' tags in HTML that are still fun to play with, though you shouldn't use deprecated tags such as these tags in your markup. Still, can you use the old <marquee> tag to make the h1 title scroll horizontally? (if you do, don't forget to remove it afterwards)


Assaignment
Imagine you are designing, or redesigning, your personal web site. Create a graphical mockup of your site, and then write down the HTML markup you would use to build out the various elements of the site. You can use software of your choice, just make sure to hand-code the HTML markup.
